Application for stepper motor. Direct drive. On orbit rotation imitation


Program for controlling a stepper motor for satellite rotation in a vacuum chamber.
It simulates the passage of a satellite under the sunlit conditions on orbit. When the sun hides behind the Earth - it returns to the previous state.
The start is when the sun rises, the end is when the sun sets.

Initial data:

Total rotation time 97.5 minutes
Time while sunlit 33 minutes
Time in shadow 64.5 minutes
number of test cycles 5-7
Calculations:

Rotation angle 121.846
Motor step 1.8 degrees
Stepper motor should make 67,777 steps
The sunlit side lasts 1980 seconds
One step in 29.213 seconds
Total time of orbit 5850
